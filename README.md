# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Sameera (any) and some of my favorite games are Splatoon 3, Minecraft, Final Fantasy, and Pokemon(although I only played a ripoff on Roblox when I was younger). I do want to play more games now because I am hoping to make friends that like different video games that we can play together or talk about. I also just have too many games I bought but haven't played yet or at all, like Animal Crossing(Wild World), Legends of Zelda (twilight Princess and Skyward Sword), Bayonetta, and some other games mostly for the Wii or DSi. I also want to play more indie games because I found so many interesting ones, but only watched a playthrough to research for my final game for a class in high school. The class I took in high school was a game programming class (Taught by Mr. Yee at Mission Vista in case you had other students from him and were curious) where we used Unity + Visual Studio and did our programming in C#. We had with games that we did along the course of the class that way that were more of a teacher demonstration than something we made on our own, and 2-D + 3-D games that we made in groups of students. I think that there will be a lot of overlap between what I learned there and what will be taught in this class so hopefully that will help me. I also used to work at codeNinjas where they used unity but I didn't get to use my Unity knowledge super often. I do eventually hope to program games at a game studio, maybe a smaller or independent studio if it gives me more agency. I don't really have a preference for what kinds of games to make so far, but the games I have made were platformers, some test games to try things like raycasting, canvases, nav mesh agents, and a point and click horror (-ish) story game using the concepts I tested. The only thing I'm hoping to avoid (at least for now) is anything with too much intense physics/math.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I do hope that this class will help me learn some more things that will be helpful in a more professional setting like dev logs, and how to actually use GitHub. In out final game programming class we used Plastic SCM which was kind of a disaster because we were trying to make the free version work and we also weren't thoroughly taught how to use it. I also feel like the class was very formal and we didn't learn a ton of terms so I hope to learn that too.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?\
I just want to make sure I don't end up getting overwhelmed with adjusting to college or get behind because of the pacing and end up not learning or getting a bad grade.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
   C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and Pyret(if that counts) from high school classes

2. Game development (any engine)
   Unity

3. Unity
   Making 2-D and 3-D games.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A

2. Scope management
N/A

3. Iteration
i think it has something to do with creating something within the code but I only remember it vaguely from an AP review packet.

4. Object-Oriented programming
Programming with the intention to make things that have properties and can interact in a way similar to how things interact in real life.  

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
N/A
